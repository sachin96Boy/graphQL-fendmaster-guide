# Advanced SDL

## Enums

A set of discrete values that can be used in places of Scalars. An enum field must resolve to oe of the values in the num.
Great for limiting a field to only a few different options.

## Interfaces

Abstract Types that can't be used as field values but insted used as foundations for explict Types. Great for when you have Types that share common fields, but differe slightly.
